# Scrap Collection and Recycling Management System

This project is a web and mobile-based application that manages the process of scrap collection and recycling. It connects users, staff, recyclers, and admin to ensure smooth collection, recycling, and redistribution of waste materials.

## Overview

- *Staff*, managed by approved recycling factories, collect the scrap from users.
- *Recyclers (factories)* can register and must be approved by the *Admin* before accessing the system.
- *Admin* manages users, approves recyclers, and oversees system data (but does not manage staff).
